# hello-world
Here is Jeff, an international student of Humber College from Hong Kong, China.
I hold a dream, which is hard for me to reach.
Like entropy, the doomed end; Failure, part of my life.
I will never give up.
Hope build my bone and knowledge enrich my soul.
Let's fly, till we reach our dream - Our journey is the ocean of stars.
